## Overview

This project is a console-based implementation of Tic Tac Toe, written in C++. It elevates the standard gameplay with:

- **ANSI Color Codes:** Player X appears in bold red, and Player O shines in vibrant blue.
- **Enhanced Board Visuals:** Unicode box-drawing characters and a stylish header create an eye-catching game board.
- **Dynamic Screen Clearing:** The console refreshes between moves for a seamless experience (compatible with Unix and Windows).

---

## Features

- **Color-Coded Players:** Easily distinguish between players with red and blue markers.
- **Dynamic and Clean UI:** The game screen refreshes after each move for a polished terminal look.
- **Decorative Header:** A sleek header crowns the board every time it‚Äôs redrawn.
- **Input Validation:** Ensures moves are valid, preventing errors or repeats.
- **Win and Draw Detection:** Checks rows, columns, and diagonals for wins, and detects draws when the board fills up.

---

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler:** Requires a compiler like g++ or clang++.
- **Terminal Support:** Must support ANSI escape codes for colors (most Unix systems and Windows 10+ terminals work).
- **Standard C++ Library:** Uses only standard libraries‚Äîno extra dependencies needed.
